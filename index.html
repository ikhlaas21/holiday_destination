    <ul>
      <li>Venice — known also as the "Floating City" — has no roads accessible by car.</Br> It is an archipelago of 118 islands connected by numerous canals and bridges.</Br> Therefore, ferries and boats are the means of transport around the city.</Br> The Grand Canal — the major waterway of Venice — is 3.8 kilometers long and sweeps through the whole city.</li>
      <li>There are endless gorgeous views, canals, gondolas, and buildings and the intricate branch of architecture originated in Venice in the 14th century.</li>
      <li> The city has a fresh supply of fish and shellfish from its lagoon.</li>
      <li>Venice has a bustling arts scene thanks to its history. <br>You will be able to visit plenty of museums and galleries that showcase some of the world’s most interesting displays of contemporary art.</li>
      <li> Gelato is famous all across Italy, but some of the best is arguably from a tiny outlet located in Venice: the Boutique del Gelato.</br> There are always huge crowds waiting to sample the delicious gelato, and it’s well worth the wait if you want to try out their unique flavours.</li>
